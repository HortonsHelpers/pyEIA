# About

Currently WIP -- There is a working version that was originally meant for internal use.  That code will be refactored and cleaned up and pushed to this repo in the coming weeks.  

This is a simply python wrapper for the Energy Information Administration's API.
It contains a command line browser mimicking the online [api browser](http://www.eia.gov/beta/api/qb.cfm), as well as 
regex-powered searches for flagging data for export.

# Requirements

Also, assumed that user has some familiarity with the following : 
* [EIA API](http://www.eia.gov/developer/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
